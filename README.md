# SatisfactoryMods
This is where my SF mods go.
If you need to build these, they go in the Plugins folder of the SML 3.0.0 Starter Project.

## What is SML?
#### That's the Satisfactory Mod Loader (https://github.com/satisfactorymodding/SatisfactoryModLoader)
Those guys are awesome. They built a whole modloader for Satisfactory, a mod manager, a mod repository (site that stores mods) and maintain a discord for it all.
See the link for details.



## Plugins:

* CheapTrains : Progressive Trains and Drones (NEEDS SML)
* SFServerManager : the Plugin counterpart to my SFServerManager Panel. (SML Not Required)
