# SatisfactoryMods
This is where my SF mods go.
If you need to build these, they go in the Plugins folder of the SML 3.0.0 Starter Project.


By SML, I mean the Satisfactory Mod Loader (https://github.com/satisfactorymodding/SatisfactoryModLoader)
Those guys are awesome.





Plugins:

CheapTrains is Cheap Trains and Drones

SFServerManager is the Plugin counterpart to my SFServerManager Panel.

The source of the plugin will live here, Binary builds in the Panel repo. The panel repo is (https://github.com/pacas00/SFServerManager)
